You are given a string title consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters. Capitalize the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:

    If the length of the word is 1 or 2 letters, change all letters to lowercase.
    Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.

Return the capitalized title.

 

Example 1:

Input: title = "capiTalIze tHe titLe"
Output: "Capitalize The Title"
Explanation:
Since all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

Example 2:

Input: title = "First leTTeR of EACH Word"
Output: "First Letter of Each Word"
Explanation:
The word "of" has length 2, so it is all lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

Example 3:

Input: title = "i lOve leetcode"
Output: "i Love Leetcode"
Explanation:
The word "i" has length 1, so it is lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.
