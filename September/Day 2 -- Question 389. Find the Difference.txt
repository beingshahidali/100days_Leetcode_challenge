You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
