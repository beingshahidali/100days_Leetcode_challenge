You are given an encoded string s. To decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:

    If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
    If the character read is a digit d, the entire current tape is repeatedly written d - 1 more times in total.

Given an integer k, return the kth letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leet2code3", k = 10
Output: "o"
Explanation: The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".
The 10th letter in the string is "o".

Example 2:

Input: s = "ha22", k = 5
Output: "h"
Explanation: The decoded string is "hahahaha".
The 5th letter is "h".

Example 3:

Input: s = "a2345678999999999999999", k = 1
Output: "a"
Explanation: The decoded string is "a" repeated 8301530446056247680 times.
The 1st letter is "a".
